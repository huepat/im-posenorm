# IM-PoseNorm: Pose Normalization of Indoor Mapping Datasets

Dear colleagues,

Thank you for your interest in our work!

This repository will contain the code for the publication "Pose Normalization of Partially Manhattan World Conform Indoor Mapping Point Clouds and Triangle Meshes".\
As the publication of the paper overlaps in time with the deadline for finishing my phd thesis, I am afraid that I am currently not able to do the necessary code cleanup and documentation.\
I assure that the code will be provided until **end of September**.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards

Patrick HÃ¼bner
